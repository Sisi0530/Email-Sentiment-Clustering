# EmailSentimentClustering

Code implementation for sentiment clustering with topic and temporal information for Enron Email subset. Revised clustering method based on DBSCAN algorithm [1]. Features extracted using Opinion word list developed by [2], containing 2,046 positive words and phases, and 4,833 negative words and phases.. If you make use of this implementation for your research, please cite the following paper:

Notes:
  1. run SentimentClustering.java
  2. change input and output file directory
  3. input format: <id, topic, timestamp, [features]>. Eg. <1633, Other, 980467200000, [rich, -drag, -drag, -difficult, consistent]>
  4. sample output: 
      <141004:General Operation-[sufficient, decent, like, great]: SP>
      <54456:Other-[-poor, -wretched]: SN>
      <140992:Private Issue-[-break, helpful, easier]: P>
